## Unreleased

* Catch SecurityExceptions thrown during fetching of Google Advertising ID. This is caused by older versions of Google Play Services using `MODE_WORLD_READABLE` when reading from SharedPreferences. If you see this warning you should update your version of Google Play Services.

## 2.18.1 (May 07, 2018)

* Updating to [OkHttp 3.10.0](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-3100)
* Lowering event upload max batch size from 100 to 50. This should help to avoid out of memory issues on Android devices with low memory.

## 2.18.0 (April 19, 2018)

* Added a `setUserId` method with optional boolean argument `startNewSession`, which when `true` starts a new session after changing the userId.

## 2.17.0 (February 05, 2018)

* Add ability to specify a custom `platform` value during initialization as an input argument. If the value is `null` or an empty string then `platform` will default to `Android`.

## 2.16.0 (November 27, 2017)

* Expose a public `getUserPropertiesOperations` method on the `Identify` class.
* Handle exceptions when the LocationManager is not available for fetching location.

## 2.15.0 (October 04, 2017)

* Updating to latest version of OkHttp3 ([3.9.0](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-390))

## 2.14.1 (July 27, 2017)

* Switch to an internal implementation of `isEmptyString` instead of Android TextUtils.

## 2.14.0 (July 05, 2017)

* Add support for logging events to multiple Amplitude apps. See our [Help Center Documentation](https://amplitude.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002935588#logging-events-to-multiple-projects) for details.

## 2.13.4 (May 09, 2017)

* Handle exceptions when fetching device carrier information. Thanks to @fkam-tt for the pull request.
* Copy userProperties on main thread in `setUserProperties` to prevent ConcurrentModificationExceptions.
* Migrating setup instructions and SDK documentation in the README file to Zendesk articles.

## 2.13.3 (March 13, 2017)

* Handle exceptions when reading from database. Only affects certain Fairphone and LG devices.
* Handle exceptions when building request to upload event data. Only affects certain Lenovo devices.

## 2.13.2 (December 22, 2016)

* Fix crash when pulling null unsent event strings during upload.
* Fix bug where unserializable events were being saved to unsent events table.
* Added more logging around JSON serialization errors when logging events.

## 2.13.1 (December 15, 2016)

* Fix bug where `regenerateDeviceId` was not being run on background thread. DeviceInfo.generateUUID() should be a static method.

## 2.13.0 (December 05, 2016)

* Add helper method to regenerate a new random deviceId. This can be used in conjunction with `setUserId(null)` to anonymize a user after they log out. Note this is not recommended unless you know what you are doing. See [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Android#logging-out-and-anonymous-users) for more information.

## 2.12.0 (November 07, 2016)

* Allow `logEvent` with a custom timestamp (milliseconds since epoch). See [documentation](https://rawgit.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Android/master/javadoc/com/amplitude/api/AmplitudeClient.html#logEvent-java.lang.String-org.json.JSONObject-org.json.JSONObject-org.json.JSONObject-org.json.JSONObject-long-boolean-) for more details.

## 2.11.0 (October 26, 2016)

* Add ability to log identify events outOfSession, this is useful for updating user properties without triggering session-handling logic. See [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Android#tracking-sessions) for more information.

## 2.10.0 (October 12, 2016)

* Catch and handle `CursorWindowAllocationException` thrown when the SDK is querying from the SQLite DB when app memory is low. If the exception is caught during `initialize`, then it is treated as if `initialize` was never called. If the exception is caught during the uploading of unsent events, then the upload is deferred to a later time.
* Block event property and user property dictionaries that have more than 1000 items. This is to block properties that are set unintentionally (for example in a loop). A single call to `logEvent` should not have more than 1000 event properties. Similarly a single call to `setUserProperties` should not have more than 1000 user properties.
* Handle IllegalArgumentException thrown by Android Geocoder for bad lat / lon values.

## 2.9.2 (July 14, 2016)

* Fix bug where `enableLocationListening` and `disableLocationListening` were not being run on background thread. Thanks to @elevenfive for PR.
* Update `Revenue` class to expose public `equals` and `hashCode` methods.

## 2.9.1 (July 11, 2016)

* Fix bug where `setOptOut` was not being run on background thread.
* `productId` is no longer a required field for `Revenue` logged via `logRevenueV2`.
* Fix bug where receipt and receiptSignature were being truncated if they were too long (exceeded 1024 characters).

## 2.9.0 (July 07, 2016)

* Add automatic flushing of unsent events on app close/minimize (through the Activity Lifecycle `onPause` callback). This only works if you call `Amplitude.getInstance().enableForegroundTracking(getApplication());`, which is recommended in the README by default for Setup. To disable you can call `Amplitude.getInstance().setFlushEventsOnClose(false);`

## 2.8.0 (June 29, 2016)

* Run the `initialize` logic on the background thread so that the SQLite database operations do not delay the main thread.
* Add support for Amazon Advertising ID (use in place of Google Advertising ID on Amazon devices). Thanks to @jcomo for the pull request.

## 2.7.2 (May 24, 2016)

* Add documentation for SDK functions. You can take a look [here](https://rawgit.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Android/master/javadoc/index.html). A link has also been added to the Readme.
* Fix bug where fetching the user's location on select devices throws a SecurityException, causing a crash.

## 2.7.1 (April 19, 2016)

* RevenueProperties is a confusing name and should actually be eventProperties. Deprecating Revenue.setRevenueProperties and replacing it with Revenue.setEventProperties, and clarified in Readme.

## 2.7.0 (April 19, 2016)

* Add support setting groups for users and events. See [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Android#setting-groups) for more information.
* Add helper method `getSessionId` to expose the current sessionId value.
* Add `logRevenueV2` and new `Revenue` class to support logging revenue events with properties, revenue type, and verified. See [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Android#tracking-revenue) for more info.
* Fix crash when trying to enableForegroundTracking with the PinnedAmplitudeClient. AmplitudeClient methods should be using `this` instead of static `instance` variable.

## 2.6.0 (March 29, 2016)
